# Voice2Note 🎙️📝

Voice2Note is an AI-powered web application that transforms your voice recordings into organized, searchable notes.

## Disclaimers ⚠️
- Frontend (CSS, HTML and Scripts) was mostly generated by LLMs and personally iterated.
- Some complex Backend and Lambdas methods were assisted by LLMs, such as audio processing or vector generation functions.
