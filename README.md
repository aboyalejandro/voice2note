### Disclaimers ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Frontend (CSS, HTML and Scripts) was mostly generated by LLMs and personally iterated.
- Some complex Backend and Lambdas methods were coded manually, but assisted by LLMs, such as audio processing, caching, or vector generation functions.

## How It Works üîÑ

Voice2Note uses a combination of AWS services and OpenAI's GPT to process your audio:

1. **Recording**: Record directly in your browser or upload audio files
2. **Processing**: AWS Transcribe converts speech to text
3. **Enhancement**: GPT generates titles and summaries
4. **Organization**: Notes are stored with metadata for easy searching
5. **Access**: Browse, search, and edit your notes anytime
6. **Data pipeline**: dbt-core runs aggregations in Postgres and Airbyte replicates the output schema to Motherduck.
7. **OLAP**: Motherduck is used for extra prompting to classify notes into different categories, topics and usage types.
